## Problem Overview

**Title:** Nested Bracket Weight Calculator

**Description:**  
Given a string containing only `[`, `]`, `{`, `}`, calculate the "weight" of valid nested brackets:

- `[]` contributes 1 × depth to total score.  
- `{}` contributes 2 × depth to total score.

- Invalid or mis-nested brackets are ignored.

**Input:**  
A string `s` (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 100000)

**Output:**  
An integer representing the total weight of valid nested brackets.
